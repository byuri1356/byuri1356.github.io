You're meant to have fun in life. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. That's crazy.

You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. We have a fantastic little sky! Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. We can fix anything.

Clouds are free they come and go as they please. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Don't fight it, use what happens.
