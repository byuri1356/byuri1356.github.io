Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.

Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. In your world you have total and absolute power.

I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Don't fiddle with it all day. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
